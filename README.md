Sometimes we just need to go back to basics, this repo tracks my progress while I revisit core PyTorch concepts.

## Projects at a glance

### 01 — `LinearRegression.ipynb`
- Simple linear regression in PyTorch
- Trained with `SGD` + `MSELoss`
- Clean training loop and loss curves

### 02 — Classification
- **Binary** (*make_circles*): MLP trained with `BCEWithLogitsLoss` (apply sigmoid at inference)
- **Multiclass** (*make_blobs*): MLP trained with `CrossEntropyLoss` (softmax at inference)
